Music Catalog API
This is a FastAPI application designed to manage a personal music collection. It allows you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on songs, now with persistent data storage, advanced search capabilities, external lyrics fetching, and asynchronous metadata enrichment.

üöÄ Project Stages Completed
Stage 1: Basic CRUD API (Completed!)
Initial setup with FastAPI and in-memory storage.

Implemented core CRUD operations for songs.

Stage 2: Persistent Data & Enhanced Search (Completed!)
Elevated the API from an in-memory demonstration to a robust application with durable data storage.

Integrated SQLite database and SQLAlchemy ORM for persistent storage.

Introduced a comprehensive song search endpoint (GET /songs/search/) with filtering by title, artist, album, genre, release_year.

Added pagination (skip, limit) to search results.

Stage 3: External Integration - Lyrics Fetcher (Completed!)
Introduced the ability to fetch song lyrics from an external API (lyrics.ovh).

Implemented an in-memory TTL cache (cachetools) for lyrics results to improve performance and reduce external API calls.

Ensured graceful handling of external API responses and clear error messages.

Stage 4: Scalable Architecture - Metadata Enrichment (Completed!)
Implemented an asynchronous service to enrich song data with additional metadata (e.g., BPM, mood, enriched genre).

Added an endpoint (POST /enrich-metadata) that triggers a background task (using FastAPI's BackgroundTasks) to call a mock external service.

Enriched metadata is stored persistently in the database.

The main song retrieval endpoints (GET /songs/, GET /songs/{song_id}) now return the enriched metadata.

Pagination has been added to the main GET /songs/ endpoint.

üí° Features
FastAPI Framework: Robust and high-performance web APIs.

Pydantic Models: Data validation and serialization/deserialization.

SQLAlchemy ORM: Seamless interaction with SQLite database.

Persistent Data: Song data stored in sql_app.db (SQLite).

Comprehensive CRUD Operations: POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE for songs.

Advanced Search Functionality: Filter songs by title, artist, album, genre, release_year.

Pagination: Control results with skip and limit parameters.

External Lyrics Integration: Fetch lyrics from lyrics.ovh.

In-Memory Caching: Cache lyrics results for 10 minutes.

Asynchronous Metadata Enrichment: Background tasks for non-blocking data enrichment.

Enriched Metadata: Store and retrieve bpm, mood, enriched_genre for songs.

HTTP Status Codes: Appropriate responses for clear communication.

Error Handling: Meaningful responses for various scenarios.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.12+ (or the specific Python version you used for venv creation)

pip (Python package installer)

(Optional, but recommended for database inspection) DB Browser for SQLite: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

1. Clone the Repository
   If you haven't already, clone the project repository:

git clone https://github.com/absra47/song_managment.git
cd song_managment # Or adjust to your project's root directory name

2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
   It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

python3.12 -m venv venv # Creates a virtual environment named 'venv'
source venv/bin/activate # Activates the virtual environment

# On Windows, use `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (Command Prompt) or `.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1` (PowerShell)

3. Install Dependencies
   Install all the necessary Python packages. These are listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(If you don't have requirements.txt generated yet, you can run: pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" sqlalchemy python-dotenv requests cachetools)

4. Database Setup
   The application uses an SQLite database. It will be created automatically on startup.

Environment Variables: Create a new file named .env in the root of your project directory (the same level as main.py).

Add the following line to it:

DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./sql_app.db"

This line tells the application the connection string for your SQLite database file.

üöÄ How to Run
Once setup is complete, you can start the FastAPI server:

Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

Run the application:

uvicorn main:app --reload

The --reload flag is useful during development, as it automatically restarts the server whenever you save changes to your code.

Access the API Documentation:
Once the server is running, you can interact with your API through the interactive documentation (powered by Swagger UI) at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Alternatively, you can view the ReDoc documentation at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

üìö API Endpoints and Usage
Here's a quick overview of the available endpoints and how to interact with your music catalog. For detailed examples, refer to the interactive documentation (Swagger UI).

1. Create a Song
   URL: /songs/

skip: Number of records to skip (for pagination, default 0).

limit: Maximum number of records to return (for pagination, default 100).

Example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/songs/?skip=0&limit=10

3. Get a Song by ID
   URL: /songs/{song_id}
